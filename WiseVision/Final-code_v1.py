SC.py - Shop SELLER vs CLIENT + entry counting + PEC (interaction) counting.
STANDALONE: no dependency on bot-sort.py -- everything is inlined here.

What it does, per processed frame:
  1) SEED (first SEED_SECONDS): everyone detected is a SELLER (bootstraps staff).
  2) ROLE: a person is SELLER if their lower body matches the learned UNIFORM
     beige band AND they show a white top. This VOTES per BoT-SORT track: after
     SELLER_VOTES matching frames the track is locked SELLER and stays SELLER on
     every later frame (anti-flicker). A staff-desk ZONE also forces SELLER (for a
     seated staffer whose pants are hidden). Everyone else is CLIENT (no id shown).
  3) ENTRY COUNT: a CLIENT is counted +1 when their box center crosses the
     doorway line INTO the shop (crossing the other way = exit). Sellers are never
     counted. Keyed on the BoT-SORT track id (only to detect the crossing edge).
  4) INTERACTION: a CLIENT within INTERACTION_DIST px of any seller for
     >= INTERACTION_MIN_SECS of continuous contact = ONE interaction, counted
     once per client track id (the same client is never double-counted).
  5) MIRROR zones drop reflections; IGNORE zones drop static false detections.

Tracking uses BoT-SORT (boxmot) with OSNet ReID -- ONLY to give track ids; the
SELLER decision is uniform COLOR, not ReID.

PRODUCTION: the uniform color band is BAKED IN (UNIFORM_BAND_*), learned once
from reference crops, so NO image folder is needed at runtime.
